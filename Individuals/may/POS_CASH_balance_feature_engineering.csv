EXP_CNT_INSTALMENT,EXP_CNT_INSTALMENT = Previous month’s CNT_INSTALMENT smoothed over time with alpha=0.6,Exponentially weighted average of the number of installments paid so far.
EXP_CNT_INSTALMENT_FUTURE,EXP_CNT_INSTALMENT_FUTURE = Future months’ CNT_INSTALMENT_FUTURE smoothed over time with alpha=0.6,Exponentially weighted average of the number of future installments remaining.
SK_DPD_RATIO,SK_DPD_RATIO = SK_DPD / (SK_DPD_DEF + 0.00001),"The ratio of overdue days (SK_DPD) to total days overdue (SK_DPD_DEF), used to understand the severity of the overdue."
TOTAL_TERM,TOTAL_TERM = CNT_INSTALMENT + CNT_INSTALMENT_FUTURE,"Total term of the loan, calculated by summing current and future installments."
